> Health Warning it Takes 15-20 mins to Set-up as your are building a workspace from scratch. However, once you've created the workspace re-launching it won't require much work as all of the installation will be cached. It means we'll all be working with the same set-up. Just let it do its thing in the background, make sure you don't close the browser and maintain a stable Internet connection. You won't need to download anything to your computer.

You have 50 hours free work time per month! This is quite generous and means you can make use of it for collaborative projects in the future.

### Step 6: Make Changes to the File

Once you work your way through loading the renv pre-specified files in the `renv.lock` you will install additional packages along the way. To save these to your lock file you will need to uncomment the following line of code in the final chunk, `renv::snapshot()`. Click `Ctrl+S` to save changes to your quarto file. As soon as you do this you will see the version control on the left pane has flagged to you that something's changed. To practice using git you will need to click onto the tab below and follow the steps to committing your upadated qmd file and `renv.lock` files. Note because you don't have owner access to the repository you will be prompted to fork 
the repository before you're able to commit any changes. Then you can follow along additional steps through GitHub to merge your updated code to the original repository
you are contributing to through a merge pull request, this might be a task for another day though. Well done ✨✨ !
